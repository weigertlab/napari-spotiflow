# Spotiflow: napari plugin

Napari plugin for *Spotiflow*, a deep learning-based, threshold-agnostic, and subpixel-accurate spot detection method for 2D and 3D fluorescence microscopy images. The plugin allows using several pre-trained models as well as user-trained ones. For the main repository, see [here](https://github.com/weigertlab/spotiflow).

```
pip install napari-spotiflow
```

## Usage 

1. Open the image (or open one of our samples, _e.g._ `File > Open Sample > napari-spotiflow > HybISS`)
2. Start the plugin `Plugins > napari-spotiflow`
3. Select model (pre-trained or custom trained) and optionally adjust any other parameters
4. Click `Detect spots`

## Supported input formats
- 2D (YX, YXC or CYX)
- 2D+t (TYX, TYXC or TCYX)
- 3D (ZYX, ZYXC or CZYX)
- 3D+t (TZYX, TZYXC or TCZYX)
